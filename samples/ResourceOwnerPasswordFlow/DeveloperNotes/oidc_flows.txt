# Flow Chart

1. Client prepares an Authentication Request with desired request parameters.
2. Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.
3. Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User.
    * However the hell it wants to. 
	* Google/Facebook/Fingerprint/Locally/Whatever
4. Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.
5. Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client...

code-flow : 
	with an Authorization Code
	go to (6)

hybrid-flow : 
	with an Authorization Code 
	and, depending on the Response Type, one or more additional parameters
	go to (6)

implicit-flow : 
	with an ID Token and, if requested, an Access Token
	go to (8)

6. Client requests a response using the Authorization Code at the Token Endpoint.		
7. Client receives a response with an ID Token and Access Token in the body.
8. Client validates the ID Token and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.
